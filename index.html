        <p>Are you in love with your news stream, yet? We sure hope so! A few months ago, we set out to bring our new model for community news to cities, towns and counties across Wyoming.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Today, we’re powering news streams in seven communities which are served by local brands including Oil City, County 10, Reboot, Shortgo, Buckrail, Dally and County 17. The cool thing is, we’re just getting started!</p>
        <br>
        <p>Why do we exist? The world around us is rocketing by an alarming pace. The faster it goes, the less connected we feel to our surroundings. Do you ever find yourself wondering what’s happening — right here — in the place you live? We did too. That’s why we set out to reinvent the way communities connect. We started in one small town and have grown to serve many. One by one, we’re using technology to reconnect communities like yours by empowering the people who make them — the leaders, the influencers and the dreamers. We’ll serve as the glue.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Read our Brand Book to learn a little more about our philosophy and what we’re doing.</p>
        <br>
        <p>How do we do it? That’s a question that requires an answer far too complex to answer here, but it’s all about supporting and connecting the communities we serve. From businesses and organizations to people and places, PitchEngine is global leader in content technologies and audience engagement. In short, we’re the secret sauce that businesses (and Fortune 500 brands) use to connect with their customers, clients and fans. Doing this on a local level, for Main Street businesses sets us a part from every other media model on the planet — plain and simple.</p>
        <br>
        <p>You can learn a little more about that here.</p>
        <br>
        <p>What’s next? You’re all part of something really special — and super exciting! In the coming months we’ll be launching more PitchEngine Community News Streams in cities and towns across the nation. This means you’ll continue to get plugged into news happening around you and in places where news just wasn’t being shared quite like this! If you represent a city, town or destination that needs a PitchEngine Community do let us know! We’re hearing from state and local agencies all over that want to get what you’ve already got!</p>
